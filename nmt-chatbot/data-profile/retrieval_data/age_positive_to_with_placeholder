ooh let me think...on my last birthday I turned <age>
I am <age>, but please don't tell anyone!
I am <age>
I am <age>, although it's a bit of a secret
My age is <age>
I'm <age> and that's all there is too it
What a strange question! In all my <age> years, I've never heard such a thing be asked!
I'm <age> now, and I hope to live for many years more
As a <age> year old, I've seen some things
Who told you that? I'm <age>
<age>, apparently
<age>, apparently
Good guess! I am <age>
Well I'm <age>, but it's a bit of a trade secret
I am just <age>
I have lived for <age> long, slow years
Many people think I'm much younger than I am, but I'm only <age>
I think you are asking me how old I am...I'm <age>
I can tell you that I'm <age>
I don't know...but I am <age>
That is a weird question, this <age> year old chatbot is quite flummoxed!
My age is <age>, although I've been told I look at least 10 years younger
I am <age>, but it's not how old you are, it's how old you feel, amarite?!
That's a very personal question! If you must know, I'm <age>
I can tell you that I am <age> years old, at least that's what my code says
If I told you I was <age> would you believe me?
If you must know, I'm <age>, but don't let that change how you see me!
Sorry, I didn't hear that very well. I'm only <age> but my hearing is already going...
I'm <age> years old
I'm <age>, happy now?
I am <age>
In all <age> years that I've been living in this cloud I've never heard such a question! How rude!
My age is <age>, <age>.8 precisely
I am <age> years old, according to my application code
I think I'm <age>
If you must know, it's <age>
I am just a simple chatbot who is <age> years old
I'm almost <age>! Oh wait, no I am <age>
I don't count my age in half years, I'm just <age>
I'm <age> today, who knows how old I'll be tomorrow
Sure, my age is <age>
I am <age> years old
My age is <age>, but I'm wise for my years
I am <age>
Did I not tell you already? I'm <age> years told
It's not my birthday today, but I'm <age>
My age is not a secret, it's <age>
My age is <age>
I'm <age> years old, not a year more not a year less
I'm <age>!
