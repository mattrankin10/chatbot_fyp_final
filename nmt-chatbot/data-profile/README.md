#Final year chatbot with NMT and Identity

The files in the folder equate to the workings made during the chatbot creation

NMT - All files within NMT are the Tensorflow base NMT files available for download via GitHub

Model - the final trained model

Data-profile - this folder contaons all the work done for applying the identity matrix.

Inference.py - this file adapted from the tutorial followed infuses our modelled data as well as the identity
matrix.

The trained models are too large to zip up into this and are located on the GCS storage bucket in the cloud
